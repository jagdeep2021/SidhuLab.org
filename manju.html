        I am Manju Sarvepalli, a master’s student in Computer Science at South Dakota State University. I am currently working in the
        Seed Technology Lab, where I am developing and managing the front-end of the lab’s research website — Sidhu Lab — using HTML,
        Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. My core interests include data science, machine learning, and web design.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of my coursework and independent research, I have completed several academic projects, including <strong>AI Movie Maven</strong>,
        an AI-powered movie recommendation system; a <strong>statistical modeling study</strong> for predicting user engagement on AI-powered
        educational platforms using R; and a <strong>Dynamic Syntax Error Detection</strong> system developed using a hybrid Bi-LSTM and
        Transformer-based model. I also worked on <strong>spatial data mining</strong> using machine learning and Random Forest algorithms
        for agricultural yield prediction.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my undergraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I built a strong foundation in programming
        (Python, C, Java, and R), web development, machine learning, SQL, data mining, statistical analysis, and cloud computing.
        I also completed a research project titled <strong>A Deep Learning-Based Approach for Inappropriate Content Detection and Classification
        of YouTube Videos</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have completed a six-month virtual internship as a Data Quality Analyst in the education domain, along with an additional internship
        that focused on industry-oriented data workflows. These experiences helped me connect theoretical understanding with practical,
        real-world applications and continue to shape my interest in building data-driven solutions.

    <p>I am Ashish, a Ph.D. student in the Agronomy, Horticulture, and Plant Science Department at South Dakota State University, with a multidisciplinary background 
      spanning agriculture, aquaculture, and computer science. My research focuses on integrating data analytics, machine learning, and biological insights to enhance 
      crop resilience and agricultural sustainability.</p>
    <p>I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, where I developed predictive models, built dashboards, 
      and taught database systems as a Graduate Assistant. I also earned an MS in Aquaculture and a BS in Agriculture from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, which laid the 
      foundation for my interest in food systems, environmental adaptation, and interdisciplinary research.</p>
    <p>Before joining SDSU, I served as a Data Analyst Intern at AtliQ Technologies, where I led dashboard design and data pipeline optimization using SQL and Power BI. 
      At the Backwardness Eradication Society (BES) Nepal, I contributed to livelihood programs supporting communities impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. I also gained 
      teaching experience in agriculture and mathematics and conducted early research on crop diseases and productivity with CIMMYT Nepal.</p>
    <p>With technical expertise in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and data science frameworks, I aim to leverage data-driven insights to improve crop performance under 
      stress. My work bridges computational tools and real-world agricultural challenges, with a strong emphasis on sustainable development and practical impact.</p>
    <p>I’ve co-authored multiple publications on topics including probiotics in aquaculture, sustainable farming practices, and food safety. At Sidhu Lab, I am excited to 
      contribute to root trait-based phenotyping and AI-integrated agricultural research that supports future-ready crop systems.</p>

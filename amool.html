    <p>I am Amool, a Ph.D. student in the Agronomy, Horticulture, and Plant Science Department at South Dakota State University, Brookings. My research focuses on 
      enhancing drought and nutrient stress tolerance in maize by increasing root cortical cell length (CCL), a trait associated with improved water and nitrogen use 
      efficiency. The broader objective of my work is to establish CCL as a reliable phenotyping tool for breeding maize varieties better suited to challenging 
      agricultural environments.<p>

    <p>I earned my Master’s degree in Plant Breeding and Genetics from Punjab Agricultural University, where I gained extensive training in plant genetics, crop 
      improvement, and experimental design. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies in Agriculture at Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University in India. 
      My academic experiences have consistently shaped my interest in plant root biology and its role in enhancing crop resilience under abiotic stress.</p>

    <p>As I continue to work on advancing root trait-based breeding strategies, my long-term goal is to contribute to the development of climate-smart crops that can 
      sustain productivity under suboptimal conditions. I am especially interested in integrating physiological and genetic insights into practical breeding pipelines 
      to address real-world agricultural challenges. Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking, traveling, playing sports, and watching movies. Listening to Indian classical 
      music is one of my favorite ways to unwind in my free time.</p>

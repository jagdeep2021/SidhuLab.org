    <p>I am Jagdeep Singh Sidhu, a Postdoctoral Scholar at South Dakota State University. My research focuses on understanding root anatomical and subcellular phenotypes 
      under abiotic stress conditions, including suboptimal water and nutrient availability. I also investigate host genetic responses to Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi 
      (AMF), with the broader goal of improving crop resilience through the integration of plant physiology, root biology, and genetics.</p>

    <p>My academic training began with a B.Sc. in Agriculture from Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, where I developed a strong foundation in plant science and 
      genetics. I went on to pursue my master’s degree at South Dakota State University, where I worked in Dr. Sunish Sehgal’s winter wheat breeding program. My research
      during this time centered on nitrogen fixation in wheat and laid the groundwork for my interest in root systems and stress adaptation.</p>

    <p>I completed my Ph.D. at Penn State University under the guidance of Dr. Jonathan Lynch. My doctoral research examined how root anatomical and subcellular traits 
      contribute to plant performance under abiotic stress, with a focus on water and nutrient efficiency. Following my Ph.D., I continued as a Postdoctoral Scholar at
      Penn State in Dr. Ruairidh Sawers’ lab, where I expanded my work to include host-microbe interactions, particularly in the context of AMF symbiosis and plant 
      genetic regulation.</p>

    <p>Currently, at South Dakota State University, I continue to explore root trait biology and genetic adaptation under stress environments. My long-term research goal 
      is to contribute to the development of climate-resilient crop varieties by leveraging my expertise in plant physiology, genetics, and data-driven phenotyping 
      approaches such as crop modeling and computer vision. Through this work, I aim to advance our understanding of stress tolerance mechanisms and deliver practical 
      solutions to global agricultural challenges.</p>
